Common_*: These directories hold projects that are standalones, and should not be bundled with iter3

Common_API		: Examples of projects are: Promises.
Common_UI		: Examples of projects are: TKX
Common_Config 	: Examples are configurations for Promises & TKX

Local_*: These directories are used to hold code specific to iter3 projects



---------------------------------

Things to create:

ThreadedNetworkPromises
	-Expand to processes even? IDK

Encrypted Sockets
	-Use Twisted for network
		-If I use twisted, threads would not be needed
		-But I have to do event driven programming?
		-Perhaps the events trigger .execute()
	-Wrap socket around basic public encrypted key algo
		-One key is decided, use AES-512?

Logging
	-Internal logs for system
	-Relayed to something outside server, to other network

------------------------------------

-Interesting idea to implement into Note Keeper
	-Ability to intelligently search through files on disk and import potential notes
	-Original algorithm could simply be based on something simple such as User selected folders
